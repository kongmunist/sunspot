# rp2040_ov2640
Quick demonstration of interfacing with an OV2640 camera from the Raspberry Pi
Pico (RP2040).

Captures images in CIF resolution (352 by 288) and sends them to a computer over
the UART. Images can be captured and the camera's registers read/written from a
small IPython shell.

```
python shell.py [serial port]
```

## Wiring
Wire the following Raspberry Pi Pico pins to an OV2640 board.

| Raspberry Pi Pico | OV2640            |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| GND               | GND               |
| 3V3(OUT)          | VCC (3.3)         |
| GP2               | RST               |
| GP3               | XCLK[^no_xclk]    |
| GP4 (I2C0 SDA)    | SDA[^i2c_pullups] |
| GP5 (I2C0 SCL)    | SCL[^i2c_pullups] |
| GP6               | D0                |
| GP7               | D1                |
| GP8               | D2                |
| GP9               | D3                |
| GP10              | D4                |
| GP11              | D5                |
| GP12              | D6                |
| GP13              | D7                |
| GP14              | PCLK              |
| GP15              | HREF              |
| GP16              | VSYNC             |

[^no_xclk]: Missing on some breakout boards like the "red" board. Leave unconnected for internal clock.

[^i2c_pullups]: Likely require I2C pullups unless breakout board provides them. Even so, adding a 10k pullup won't hurt.
